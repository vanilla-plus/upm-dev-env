  "description": "Normal is a collection of simple native classes that work with a normalized float (0.0 - 1.0). It features a number of event Actions for when it has become 0 ('empty') or 1 ('full') and several variants for specialized reasons.\n\nAny 'eased' normal modifies the float with an easing algorithm before being invoked.\n\nAny 'unsafe' normal does it's thing twice as fast as 'safe' variants - it achieves this by being sneaky with comparisons.",
