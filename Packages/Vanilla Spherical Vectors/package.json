  "description": "Spherical Vectors provides two simple methods for easily converting between traditional cartesian positions (x/y/z) and spherical positions (longitude/latitude/radius).\n\nIt doesn't even introduce any new kinds of data, just use Vector3s! Each component maps directly to its axis equivalent - for example, x maps to longitude.\n\nThis allows you to have more intuitive and powerful rotational behaviour without trying to make cartesian positions work in ways they weren't built for.",
