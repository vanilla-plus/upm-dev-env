# The second line is needed because whitelisting isn’t as simple as blocking. 
# Because of the way Git handles these files, if it sees a directory is blocked,
# it won’t even try to check anything in the directory to see if it was unblocked later.
# It simply skips it and ignores all rules inside that directory.
